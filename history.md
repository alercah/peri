# History

Rado was conceived of by myself (alercah) shortly after the SM/ALttPR combo
randomizer release An earlier design of Rado treated links as first-class entitties, and didn't
have a concept of actions. After a surge of interest, largely from the SM/ALttPR
combo randomizer community, and especially @gjgfuj, it was redesigned around the
concept of actions, which made the language more complex but also resolved a lot
of the outstanding design issues.

Earlier versions of Rado had a syntactic sugar of multi-item and multi-location
declarations which allowed declaring multiple items and/or locations with common
properties quickly. These have been temporarily removed to wait for the rest of
the language to stabilize before finding the best way to reintroduce them.

Rado was formerly called Peri; the name was changed after it had developed
negative conntations with something in m personal life (unrelated to the
language).
